Abstract: A visualization of DNS records as a force-directed graph with collapsible nodes, implemented with d3.

We would like to gain insight into the question: "Do similar IP addresses map to similar URLs?"

The force directed graph allows us to cluster linked urls and ips based on Levenshtien distance. We see clusters of similar urls linked to clusters of similar ips.
